# Sample Outputs

Note this folder contains the outputs from the workflow.scriv project. `workflow.md` is what Scrivener compiles to, and then pandocomatic runs pandoc to generate the other files. `workflow.pdf` is generated via `xelatex` from `workflow.tex`. Note that all outputs have bibliographies and most academic features intact, like academic metadata / maths / cross-referencing etc., even for plain text!

## Quarto Workflow

There are examples of output from the Scrivener + Quarto Project Template for PDF, EPUB and DOCX.

## Typst Workflow

And there is sample output for a Pandoc + Typst workflow from Scrivener, which generates PDFs much, much faster than via any sort of LaTeX path...
